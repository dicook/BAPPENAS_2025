## What is "big data"?

<br>

[*Big data is extremely overhyped and not terribly well defined. Many people think they have big data, when they actually don't.*](https://peadarcoyle.wordpress.com/2015/08/02/interview-with-a-data-scientist-hadley-wickham/) [~Hadley Wickham]{.smallest}

<br>

::: {.incremental}
- Big data problems that are actually small data problems, once you have the right subset/sample/summary. ~90%
- Big data problems that are actually lots and lots of small data problems, e.g. you need to fit one model per individual for thousands of individuals. ~9%
- Finally, there are irretrievably big problems where you do need all the data, perhaps because you fitting a complex model. 
:::

::: {.fragment}
At least when you first tackle a data problem, after which you might scale up and automate operations.

## Approach {.transition-slide .center style="text-align: center;"}

The methods and tools discussed will ensure you can get started and have a process to follow to develop the appropriate analysis.

## The pipe operator `%>%` or `|>`

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
- read as `then` 
- `x %>% f(y)` and `x |> f(y)` is the same as `f(x, y)`
- `%>%` is part of the `dplyr` package (really, `magrittr`), <br>
`|>` is part of base R 
- pipes structure code as *sequence of operations* -- as opposed to function order `g(f(x))`
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/pipe.gif)
:::
:::

## The pipe operator `%>%` or `|>`

- `%>%` is part of `dplyr` package (or more precisely, the `magrittr` package)
- R 4.1 introduced the `|>` base pipe (no package necessary)
- An explanation of the (subtle) differences between the pipes can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-native-r-pipe-98dea6d8b61b)

## Pipe Example

::: panel-tabset
### Using `%>%` {-}

```{r read TB incidence data and check, results='hide'}
tb <- read_csv("data/TB_notifications_2025-07-22.csv")
tb   %>%                                # first we get the tb data
  filter(year == 2023) %>%              # then we focus on the most recent year
  group_by(country) %>%                 # then we group by country
  summarize(
    cases = sum(c_newinc, na.rm=TRUE)   # to create a summary of all new cases
    ) %>%
  arrange(desc(cases))                  # then we sort countries to show highest number of new cases first
```

### Using `|>` {-}
```{r read TB incidence data and check base pipe, results='hide'}
tb <- read_csv("data/TB_notifications_2025-07-22.csv")
tb |>                                  # first we get the tb data
  filter(year == 2023) |>              # then we focus on the most recent year
  group_by(country) |>                 # then we group by country
  summarize(
    cases = sum(c_newinc, na.rm=TRUE)   # to create a summary of all new cases
    ) |> 
  arrange(desc(cases))                  # then we sort countries to show highest number new cases first
```

:::


```{r show-results, echo=FALSE}
tb <- read_csv("data/TB_notifications_2025-07-22.csv")
tb |>                                  # first we get the tb data
  filter(year == 2023) |>              # then we focus on the most recent year
  group_by(country) |>                 # then we group by country
  summarize(
    cases = sum(c_newinc, na.rm=TRUE)   # to create a summary of all new cases
    ) |> 
  arrange(desc(cases))                  # then we sort countries to show highest number of new cases first

## What is tidy data?

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

- What do we expect tidy data to look like?
- maybe easier: what are sources of messiness?
:::

:::

## Varying degree of messiness

::: panel-tabset
### Cryptic Names


What are the variables? Where are they located?

```{r example 1 What are the variables, echo=FALSE}
grad <- read_csv("data/graduate-programs.csv")
head(grad[c(2,3,4,6)])
```

::: notes
in the columns, subject, Inst, AvNumPubs, ...
:::

### More cryptic

What's in the column names of this data? What are the experimental units? What are the measured variables?

```{r example 2 whats in the column names, echo=FALSE}
genes <- read_csv("data/genes.csv")
head(genes)
```

::: notes
the experimental design is coded into the variable names, genotype:WI/WM, time:6/12, rep:1/2/4
:::


### Most

What are the variables? What are the records?

```{r example 3 what are the variables and records, echo=FALSE}
melbtemp <- read.fwf("data/ASN00086282.dly", 
   c(11, 4, 2, 4, rep(c(5, 1, 1, 1), 31)), fill=T)
head(melbtemp[,c(1,2,3,4,seq(5,100,4))])
```

::: notes
variables are TMAX, TMIN, PRCP, year, month, day, stationid. 

Each row contains the values for one month!
:::

### Too_much_info

What are the variables? What are the experimental units?

```{r example 4 what are the variables and experimental units, echo=FALSE}
tb <- read_csv("data/tb.csv")
tail(tb)
#colnames(tb)
```

### Tables

What are the variables? What are the observations?

```{r example 4 what are the variables and observations, echo=FALSE}
pew <- read.delim(
  file = "http://stat405.had.co.nz/data/pew.txt",
  header = TRUE,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
  check.names = F
)
pew[1:5, 1:5]
```


### Gross on repeat

10 week sensory experiment, 12 individuals assessed taste of french fries on several scales (how potato-y, buttery, grassy, rancid, paint-y do they taste?), fried in one of 3 different oils, replicated twice. 

First few rows:

```{r example 6 what are the factors measurements and experimental units, echo = FALSE}
load("data/french_fries.rda")
head(french_fries, 4)
```

What is the experimental unit? What are the factors of the experiment? What was measured? What do you want to know?

:::

## Messy data patterns

There are various features of messy data that one can observe in practice. Here are some of the more commonly observed patterns:

- Column headers are not just variable names, but also contain values
- Variables are stored in both rows and columns, contingency table format
- One type of experimental unit stored in multiple tables
- Dates in many different formats

## Tidy Data Conventions

1. Data is contained in a single table
2. Each observation forms a row (no data info in column names)
3. Each variable forms a column (no mashup of multiple pieces of information)


## Long and Wide

- Long form: **one** measured value per row. All other variables are descriptors (key variables) - good for modelling, terrible for most other analyses, e.g. correlation matrix

- Widest form: **all** measured values for an entity are in a single row. 

- Wide form: measurements are arranged by *some of the descriptors* in columns (for direct comparisons)

## Tidy verbs

- `pivot_longer`: get information out of names into columns 
- `pivot_wider`: make columns of observed data for levels of design variables (for comparisons)
- `separate`/`unite`: split and combine columns
- `nest`/`unnest`: make/unmake variables into sub-data frames of a list variable

## Pivot to long form

::: columns
::: {.column width=70%}

```
data |> pivot_longer(cols, names_to = "name", values_to = "value", ...)
```

- `pivot_longer` turns a wide format into a long format

- two new variables are introduced (in key-value format): **name** and **value**

- `col` defines which variables should be combined

![[Image source](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/)](https://github.com/gadenbuie/tidyexplain/raw/main/images/tidyr-pivoting.gif)
:::
:::
  



## Pivoting: an example

```{r setup a simple example, echo = FALSE}
dframe <- data.frame(id = 1:2, trtA=c(2.5,4.6), trtB = c(45, 35))
```


```{r gather the example data into long form}
# wide format
dframe

# long format
dframe |> pivot_longer(trtA:trtB, names_to="treatment", values_to="outcome")
```

## Variable selectors

- `data |> pivot_longer(cols, names_to = "key", values_to = "value", ...)`

- `cols` argument identifies variables that should be combined.

- **Pattern Selectors** can be used to identify variables by **name**, **position**, a range (using `:`), a pattern, or a combination of all.

## Examples of pattern selectors

  - `starts_with(match, ignore.case = TRUE, vars = NULL)`

  - other select functions: `ends_with`, `contains`, `matches`.

  - For more details, see `?tidyselect::language`



## TB notifications
  
New notifications of TB have the form `new_sp_<sex><age group>`:
  
```{r read in and process the TB data}
read_csv("data/TB_notifications_2025-07-22.csv") |> 
  dplyr::select(country, iso3, year, starts_with("new_sp_")) |>
  na.omit() |>
  head()
```

## Pivot longer: TB notifications
  
create two new variables: `name` and `value`

- `name` contains all variable names starting with "new_sp_" 
- `value` contains all values of the selected variables
  
```{r turn TB data into long form}
tb1 <- read_csv("data/TB_notifications_2025-07-22.csv") |> 
  dplyr::select(country, iso3, year, starts_with("new_sp_")) |>
  pivot_longer(starts_with("new_sp_")) 

tb1 |> na.omit() |> head()
```

## Separate columns
  
```
data |> separate_wider_delim (col, delim, names, ...)
```

- split column `col` from data frame `frame` into a set of columns as specified in `names`
- `delim` is the delimiter at which we split into columns, splitting separator. 


## Separate TB notifications
  
Work on `name`: 
  
```{r extract variable names from original column names}
tb2 <- tb1 |>
  separate_wider_delim(
    name, delim = "_", 
    names=c("toss_new", "toss_sp", "sexage")) 

tb2 |> na.omit() |> head()
```

## Separate columns
  
`data %>%  separate_wider_position(col, widths, ...)`

- split column `col` from `frame` into a set of columns specified in `widths`
- `widths` is named numeric vector where the names become column names; unnamed components will be matched but not included. 

## Separate TB notifications again
  
Now split `sexage` into first character (m/f) and rest.

  
```{r continue extracting variable names}
tb3 <- tb2 %>% dplyr::select(-starts_with("toss")) |> # remove the `toss` variables
  separate_wider_position(
    sexage,
    widths = c(sex = 1, age = 4),
    too_few = "align_start"
  )

tb3 |> na.omit() |> head()
```



The data could be made prettier but it is now in form that can be analysed with standard handling.


## Try this one

Read the genes data from folder `data`. Column names contain data and are kind of messy. 

```{r}
genes <- read_csv("data/genes.csv")

names(genes)
```

Produce the data frame called `gtidy` as shown below:

```{r}
#| label: code solution to genes wrangling
#| code-fold: true
gtidy <- genes |>
  pivot_longer(-id, names_to="variable", values_to="expr") |>
  separate_wider_delim(variable, names=c("trt", "leftover"), 
                       delim = "-") |>
  separate_wider_delim(leftover, names=c("time", "rep"), 
                       delim = ".") |>
  mutate(trt = sub("W", "", trt)) |>
  mutate(rep = sub("R", "", rep))
```

```{r}
head(gtidy)
```


## Plot the genes data overlaid with group means

::: columns
::: column
```{r compute group means, fig.show='hide'}
gmean <- gtidy |> 
  group_by(id, trt, time) |> 
  summarise(expr = mean(expr))
gtidy |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = trt, y = expr, colour=time)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(data = gmean, aes(group = time)) +
  facet_wrap(~id) +
  scale_colour_brewer("", palette="Set1")
```
:::
::: column
```{r plot the genes data overlaid with group means, echo=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height = 5}
gtidy |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = trt, y = expr, colour=time)) +

##  {.information-slide .center style="text-align: center;"}

Getting data into tidy form is the singularly most efficient and generalisable way to do data analysis


## Initial data analysis (IDE) {.transition-slide .center style="text-align: center;"}

## Objectives

The [**main objective for IDA**]{.monash-blue2} is to intercept any problems in the data that might adversely affect the confirmatory data analysis. 

**_IDA is often unreported_** in the data analysis reports or scientific papers, for various reasons. It might not have been done, or it may have been conducted but there was no space in the paper to report on it. 

[**Good practice**]{.monash-blue2} expects that this work is transparent and repeatable and changeable. 

## Data cleaning 

The purpose of [data cleaning]{.monash-blue2} is to bring data up to a level of quality such that it can reliably be used for the production of statistical models or statements.

A [statistical value chain]{.monash-blue2} is constructed by defining a number of meaningful intermediate data products, for which a chosen set of quality attributes are well described.

## Data screening 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.info}
It's important to check how the data are [understood by the computer]{.monash-blue2}.
:::

that is, checking for _data type_: 

* Was the date read in as character?
* Was a factor read in as numeric?
:::    
::: {.column width=50%}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
xlsx_df <- read_excel("data/lecture3-example.xlsx",
                 col_types = c("text", "date", "text", "numeric"))  |> 
  mutate(id = as.factor(id), 
         date = as.character(date),
         date = as.Date(date, format = "%Y-%d-%m"))
```

You can visualise the data type with the `visdat` package:

```{r echo = TRUE}
vis_dat(xlsx_df)
```

## Case study: World development indicators [(6/7)]{.smallest}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}


Look at Costa Rica (CRI), most complete country

```{r}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 6
#| code-fold: true
wdi_cri <- wdi |>
  filter(country_code == "CRI")
vis_miss(wdi_cri, sort_miss=TRUE)
```
:::
::: {.column width=50%}

To illustrate imputation, we'll show one of the variables, that is relatively complete.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 3
#| code-fold: true
wdi_cri_p <- wdi_cri |>
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS)) +
  geom_miss_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio=0.5, 
        legend.position = "none") 
wdi_cri_p
```

Impute a few temporal missings using nearest neighbours.

## Case study: World development indicators [(6/7)]{.smallest}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}

Missings imputed using `imputeTS` using the moving average method. 

```{r}
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 3
#| code-fold: true
wdi_cri_v1 <- wdi_cri |>
  mutate(SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS = na_ma(SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS))

wdi_cri_v1  |>
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se=F, colour="#D55E00") +
  theme(aspect.ratio=0.5) 
```

:::
::: {.column width=50%}

- Don't have to impute before scrutinizing data
- What are these numbers supposed to be?

`SE.PRM.CMPT.ZS` is "Primary completion rate, total (% of relevant age group)"


[Do we have any problems?]{.monash-orange2}

::: {.fragment}
Yes. The explanation of the variable suggests the numbers should range between 0-100.

## Reproducibility, workflow and versioning {.transition-slide .center style="text-align: center;"}

## Dynamic documents

- **Efficiency**: allow changes to be implemented more easily, especially for dynamic reproducible documents.

- **Repeatability**: the analysis can be repeated multiple times while still obtaining the same results.

- **Transparency**: everything is available for access, resulting in more trustworthy results.

- **Easy to update**: when new data arrives, the report can be automatically updated.

::: {.fragment}
These slides are an example of a dynamic document. You can extract the code and re-run all the examples. *What I show you, you can do to.*
:::

## How might the project look?

## How to combine text and data analysis?

<br>

::: {.callout-note}
## Literate programming

Literate programming is an approach to writing reports using software that weaves together the source code and text at the time of creation.
:::

::: {.smaller}

Reproducibility requires more than literate programming. These are:

- a versioning and sharing system, like GitHub and git. 
- software environment supporting workflows such as [targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) or [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).

:::

## Getting started {.transition-slide .center style="text-align: center;"}

## [First step]{style="color:#006DAE;"}

:::{.callout-caution}

## Practicing

1. Create a project.

2. Create a quarto document.

3. Render document.

:::


## Elements of a reproducible project

- All the elements of the project should be files.
- All files should be stored within the project location (typically a folder).
- All files should be explicitly tied together.

:::{.fragment}

But how do we tie the files together?

:::


## Computer paths

A path is the complete location or name of where a computer file, directory, or web page is located.

Examples:

- `Windows: C:\\Documents\\workshop`
- `Mac/Linux: /Users/Documents/workshop`
- `Internet: https://numbat.space/`

::: {.fragment}

Because these are different on different systems, you should avoid complications and use **relative** paths, 

```
raw_dat <- read_csv("data/world-development-indicators.csv", 
                    na = "..", n_max = 11935)
```

From my current directory/folder, find the `data` folder and you will find the file `world-development-indicators.csv`.

:::

## Work projects

- `data` folder: contains all the data for the project.
- `images`/`figures` folder**: contains all the external pictures not produced by the code in the qmd file.
- `.Rproj` file: automatically added when creating an RStudio project (handles the relative paths and working directories).
- `qmd` file: quarto document
- Other `R` scripts, etc...

![](images/project-example.jpg)


## Quarto details {.transition-slide .center style="text-align: center;"}

## Quarto

- Provides a framework for integrating code and text into a single document.

- The code is written within the code chunks, put the text around that, and get a fully reproducible document.

::::

Insert an R code chunk into a Quarto document with:

- Keyboard short cut Ctrl + Alt + I (Mac: Cmd + Option + I)

- Typing the chunk delimiters (```)

Chunk output can be customised with **Chunk execution options**, which are at the top of a chunk, starting with `#|`


## Chunk execution options

- `eval: false` does not evaluate (run) this code chunk when knitting.
- `echo: false` does not show the source code in the finished file.
- `include: false` prevents code and results from showing in the finished file.
- `message: false` prevents messages that are generated by code from showing in the finished file.
- `warning: false` prevents warnings that are generated from showing in the finished file
- `fig.cap = "Text"` adds a caption to a figure

There are many more; see Quarto documentation.

## Quarto templates {.transition-slide .center style="text-align: center;"}

## What is a quarto template?

The templates provide a straightforward way to get started with new Quarto projects by providing example content and options.

:::{.incremental}

1. Create a working initial document for custom formats

2. Provide the initial content for a custom project type

:::

:::{.fragment}

Remember all the painstaking work we did earlier, setting YAML, creating all the folders, and setting the execution options.

:::

:::{.fragment}

All of that can be gone with one line in the terminal!!

## 📚 Adding a Bibliography to `.qmd` Files

````markdown
### 1. Create a `.bib` File (BibTeX Format)

```bibtex
@article{smith2021,
  title = {A Method for Data Analysis},
  author = {Smith, Jane},
  journal = {Journal of Statistics},
  year = {2021}
}
````

💡 Save as: `references.bib`


### 1. Link the `.bib` File in YAML

```yaml
bibliography: references.bib
csl: apa.csl  # Optional: adds citation style (e.g., APA, IEEE)
```

### 2. Cite in the Text

```markdown
As shown in recent work [@smith2021], the method is effective.
```

🔄 Quarto will automatically format the in-text citation and generate a reference list.


## ⚙️ Quarto quirks & power tips

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

📐 LaTeX equation in a figure caption

```markdown
![This figure demonstrates the equation $E = mc^2$.](figure.png){#fig-einstein}
```

✅ You can embed LaTeX-style equations directly using dollar signs (`$...$`) in the caption.

✅ Works in both **HTML** and **PDF** outputs.

::: {.fragment}

Refer to another figure in a caption

```markdown
![Here we compare this with Figure @fig-einstein.](comparison.png){#fig-compare}
```

📝 `@fig-einstein` will resolve to the numbered figure reference (e.g., *Figure 1*) in PDF/HTML.

📌 Make sure the first figure has an ID like `{#fig-einstein}`.

:::
:::
::: {.column}

::: {.fragment}

🔗 Hyperlink in a table

```markdown
| Tool   | Link                              |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| Quarto | [quarto.org](https://quarto.org) |
```

✅ Use standard Markdown syntax inside tables: `[text](url)`

✅ Works for **external links**, local files, and section anchors.

:::
::: {.fragment}

🖼 Alt-Text in Figure Chunk

```markdown
![Scatterplot of speed vs. distance](cars-plot.png){fig-alt="A scatterplot showing car stopping distances by speed."}
```

✅ Use `fig-alt="..."` to improve **accessibility** and support screen readers.
