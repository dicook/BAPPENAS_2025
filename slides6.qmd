## About the data

https://github.com/horankev/quake_data

## Steps to take

1. Read in the two data sets
2. Subset the data to contain only quakes in 2023, small enough to experiment with
3. Make a map with earthquake locations plotted
4. Make an interactive plot of magnitude and date
5. Link the two plots so that a user can select points in one plot and examine where they are inthe other
6. Develop an animation of earthquakes over time
